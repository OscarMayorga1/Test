# Test
In this test I'll try to learn how to do commits in a repository

You only need to select the edit option, and make some changes in the files, I'm adding this line of text as my first commit.

A branch is like a copy of a project with all  the info until the point where the branch is created, then if you apply some changes in main/master
this changes will not be reflected on the branch, but you can do some commits in the branch, this is usefull when you want to try some features in 
the project keeping the main branch safe
